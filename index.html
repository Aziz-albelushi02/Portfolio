        <div class="row">
          <div class="col-lg-10 mx-auto">
            <p>
              Hello, I’m Aziz, a cybersecurity-focused professional based in
              Kuwait and the UK. While my background started in software
              development, my interests and career direction have shifted
              strongly toward security, penetration testing, and risk
              assessment.
            </p>
            <p>
              I work primarily with Python and JavaScript, using them for
              scripting, automation, and security-related tasks. I also have
              prior experience with Java, which helped build a solid foundation
              in object-oriented programming. Over time, I became particularly
              drawn to understanding how systems fail, how vulnerabilities are
              introduced, and how they can be realistically exploited and
              mitigated.
            </p>
            <p>
              My main area of focus is web application penetration testing,
              where I am most comfortable working with vulnerabilities outlined
              in the OWASP Top 10. I regularly practice and sharpen these skills
              through CTF challenges and hands-on labs on platforms such as
              TryHackMe, Hack The Box, as well as in-real-life challenges, which
              have significantly strengthened my analytical thinking and
              attacker mindset.
            </p>
            <p>
              Alongside security, I retain solid experience in web development,
              having designed and developed web pages using HTML, CSS, PHP, and
              Bootstrap. This development background allows me to approach
              security not only from an attacker’s perspective, but also with an
              understanding of how applications are built and where common
              design mistakes occur.
            </p>
            <p>
              I also have experience in mobile application development using
              Flutter (Dart), adding to my overall technical skill set. I enjoy
              combining development knowledge with hands-on offensive security
              work and continuous self-learning, allowing me to approach systems
              with a deeper and more practical security perspective.
            </p>
            <p>
              I have hands-on experience with machine learning, using Python and
              its libraries to build a machine-learning–based intrusion
              detection model aimed at detecting wireless injection attacks.
              This work gave me practical insight into how machine learning can
              support security monitoring and threat detection in real
              environments.
            </p>
            <p>
              Possession of a strong interest in cryptography particularly in
              its practical and theoretical applications as I actively explore
              cryptographic challenges in CTFs, along with independent research
              in the field. I have also helped in the development of a
              cryptography-based encryption and decryption application using the
              Java SDK, and conducted research into quantum cryptography, which
              has further strengthened my understanding of modern and emerging
              cryptographic concepts.

                    A Pacman-based game is developed using Java and allows

                    keys or the WASD keys. Each game features unique, randomly

                    suggesting lifestyle changes. Libraries such as SVM, Pandas,
                    and Decision Tree classifiers were employed, along with
                    sklearn for metrics and seaborn/matplotlib for
                    visualization. The dataset was split 80/20 for
                    training/testing, achieving a 76% accuracy. A numpy
                    calculation function aided in model evaluation and
                    prediction.
